FINAL RESULTS:

election.h:24:  [5] (buffer) gets:
  Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20). Use fgets() instead.
election.h:94:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused).
election.h:225:  [4] (buffer) scanf:
  The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits
  buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20). Specify a limit to %s, or use a
  different input function.

  maximum possible length.
